                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>The Arcane Circle is a world of unexplored mysteries, where human biology, the environment, and
                    even the
                    laws of physics are deeply altered. Others might believe arcana is mere mysticism. Or, what
                    applications
                    could it have to our society, where magic is all but nonexistent? We disagree on both counts.
                </p>
                <p>Vogorian researchers delve into the unexplored depths of Lake Agassiz, journey into the
                    breathtaking
                    forests of the Wild West, and cross the snow-carpeted plains of Osyra. We explore the hidden
                    wonders of
                    these untamed countries to push the boundaries of scientific innovation. We believe that with
                    new
                    discoveries, we can develop solutions to our world's most complex problems.</p>
                <p>Through our research into the orcish <em>wethken</em>, or "weird-women", a caste of death
                    priests, we
                    were able to create medical treatments that increase muscular strength. In the future, it is
                    possible
                    that our findings could lead to a treatment for human aging. </p>

                    <p>Our state-of-the-art main facility is located at 71 Briela Street, in the prestigious Emerald
                        District, alongside New Rhea's best hospitals and biomedical research institutes. The historic
                        Gothic stone building dates back to the 17th century and features stained-glass windows and a
                        facade with detailed carvings of serpentine figures. The interior was fully rennovated in 2019.
                        Vogorian maintains strong connections with the nearby University of Rhea Faculty of Life
                        Sciences. We keep high levels of security, so make sure to book your visit at least a
                        week in advance.</p>

                    <p>The Lake 821F Lab is four days into the Osyran tundra. Past kilometres of pristine boreal forest
                        and prairie wilderness, the "Eight-Hundred" (as it's called by our scientists) is a sprawling 3
                        km<sup>2</sup> campus on the banks of one of many of Osyra's beautiful blacklakes. Our
                        researchers live in a village of contemporary, Osyran-inspired cottages with electricity and
                        internet. To protect against high winds and snowstorms, the research facilities have 1
                        above-ground level and a full 3 below-ground levels. The whole campus is protected by a 3 meter
                        steel wall and powered by wind our own miniature nuclear reactor</p>
